# Examples of mining websites for underlying data

The two examples used so far are:

- The CCDB (Chromosome Count Database) for plants, which has a large collection of chromosome numbers of plants from many different sources. It can be visited here:
http://ccdb.tau.ac.il/
It is maintained by the Mayrose Lab (Plant Evolution, bioinformatics and comparative genomics)

- The plant C-value database, which can be found here:
