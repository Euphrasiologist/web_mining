# Examples of mining websites (amongst others) for underlying data

A repository where I mainly extract data from websites which do not provide an easily accessible data file.

## Data

Feel free to take and edit as you like, but if you are using the websites or citations above (or any other website that holds data!) please cite them in any work that you produce from them down the line.

## Future

If the reader has any ideas, please let me know!
